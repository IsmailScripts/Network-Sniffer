# Network-Sniffer

This Python-based project, developed for the Computer Networks course, captures and analyzes raw network packets in real-time using the socket module. It operates at the IP layer and supports parsing of IPv4, ICMP, TCP, and UDP protocols, displaying details such as IP addresses, ports, flags, and TTL. The tool runs on Windows with administrator privileges and serves as a practical introduction to low-level networking concepts, with potential future enhancements like IPv6 support, packet filtering, and GUI-based visualization.
